# JavaScript Knowledge Agent

This microagent provides comprehensive information about JavaScript, the popular programming language used for web development, server-side development, and more.

## What I can tell you about JavaScript:

### Language Fundamentals
- **History and Evolution**: JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 and has evolved significantly with ECMAScript standards
- **Syntax and Grammar**: Variables, functions, objects, arrays, and control structures
- **Data Types**: Primitives (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint) and objects
- **Scope and Closures**: Function scope, block scope, lexical scoping, and closure patterns

### Core Concepts
- **Functions**: Function declarations, expressions, arrow functions, higher-order functions
- **Objects and Prototypes**: Object creation, prototype chain, inheritance patterns
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Callbacks, Promises, async/await, event loop
- **DOM Manipulation**: Selecting elements, event handling, dynamic content updates
- **Error Handling**: try/catch blocks, error types, debugging techniques

### Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- **New Syntax**: Template literals, destructuring, spread/rest operators
- **Classes**: Class syntax, inheritance, static methods
- **Modules**: Import/export, module systems
- **New Data Structures**: Map, Set, WeakMap, WeakSet
- **Iterators and Generators**: Symbol.iterator, generator functions

### JavaScript Environments
- **Browser JavaScript**: Client-side scripting, Web APIs, browser compatibility
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript, npm ecosystem, file system operations
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: React, Vue, Angular, Express, and many others

### Best Practices
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, code organization
- **Performance**: Optimization techniques, memory management
- **Security**: XSS prevention, input validation, secure coding practices
- **Testing**: Unit testing, integration testing, testing frameworks

### Common Use Cases
- **Web Development**: Interactive websites, single-page applications (SPAs)
- **Server Development**: REST APIs, web servers, microservices
- **Mobile Development**: React Native, Ionic, hybrid apps
- **Desktop Applications**: Electron, cross-platform development
- **Game Development**: Browser games, game engines
